      <p>Arianna is my older sister. She works as a coordinator for the Tennis
        Channel in Santa Monica, California and has a daughter named Kennedy
        who is 8 years old. She is the closest person in my life.
        Our paths are very similar and we have many of the same passions
        and concerns. I can talk to her about anything and am so thankful for that.
